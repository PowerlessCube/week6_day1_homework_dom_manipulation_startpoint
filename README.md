##Tasks

Let's practice traversing the DOM.

create an app.js (remember to include a script tag in your HTML!) and inside your window.onload do the following: (you can add ids to the HTML tags)

1.  Get the quote of the day.
2.  Get the button.
3.  Get the last quote.
4.  Hide the quote of the day.

###DOM manipulation, callback lab.

The quotes are all hardcoded in our web page.

Let's start moving towards having a dynamic web application and set the existing quotes programatically via JavaScript.

* Create an array of the existing quotes, each quote having text and author.

  *  Add the quotes to the page dynamically with JavaScript

  * Further: - Extend our quote application so that a user can add quotes. (Don't worry about these saving between refreshing page, we'll do this tomorrow)

  * Even Further: - Add functionality to delete quotes - Style page

  * Even Even Further: - While typing show the quote being created at real time.
